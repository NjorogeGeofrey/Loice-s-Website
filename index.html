                <h3>Underwriting</h3>
                <p>Underwriting is the process of evaluating and assessing the risk of insuring a home, vehicle, individual, or company, and determining the appropriate premium that should be charged for that risk. It's a fundamental aspect of the insurance industry and critical to financial institutions when deciding to provide loans or insurance policies.Having worked at NHIF Kenya, I attained the claim unerwritting skill for both outpatient and inpatient claims
                  which included claim varification, E-claim authorization and recording.Underwriting is essential because it helps financial institutions manage risk and ensure profitability</p>
